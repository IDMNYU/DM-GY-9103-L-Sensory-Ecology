# How to solar power your projects

## Basics of Off-grid PhotoVoltaics (PV)

The core components of an off-grid solar system include the photovoltaic (PV) panel, battery, and charge controller. 

The **PV panel** converts sunlight into electricity, serving as the primary energy source for the system. <br>
The **battery** stores excess energy generated by the PV panel, providing power during periods without sunlight, such as at night or during cloudy weather. <br>
The **MPPT** (Maximum Power Point Tracking) **charge controller** optimizes the energy harvested from the PV panel, ensuring efficient charging of the battery by adjusting the voltage and current to match the system's needs.<br>

>[!WARNING]
> **Warning:** _When connecting the components of a solar system, always connect the batteries to the charge controller first, before connecting the PV panel. This ensures the charge controller is properly configured to the battery’s voltage and avoids potential damage to the system._
